# Solutions Style Guide

Submitted solutions need to conform to the following standards:

- Code needs to meet [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards. If your editor of choice doesn't check your code for you, you can `pip install pep8`, then run `pep8 <filename>.py` from the command line to check your code meets pep8 standards.
- Documentation needs to meet [pep257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) standards. You can `pip install pep257`, then run `pep257 <filename>.py` from the command line to check your documentation meets pep257 standards.
- Docstrings need to conform to [NumPy/SciPy/sklearn conventions](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt).
- Solutions should be submitted in a module with a filename that matches that section of questions. For example, solutions for the `General Programming` questions should be submitted in a file named `general_programming.py`.

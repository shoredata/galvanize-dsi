# Linear Regression Sprint

## Objectives

- Explore a data set, both continuous and categorical features.
- Specify appropriate fits for continuous and categorical features.
- Create a pipeline to create features for a regression model in sklearn.
- Fit a regression model on a flexible set of features in sklearn.
- Compute model evaluation metrics: RSS and R^2.
- Visualize model fit.
- Check a model for assumptions necessary for testing hypothesis.
- Run a simple hypothesis test in a regression model.

This sprint has only a pair exercise, so you will be working with a partner all day: [pair.md](pair.md).

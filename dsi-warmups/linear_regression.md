## Build a Linear Regression Model

You are provided with a dataset `data/loansData.csv` (found in the directory above). 
Build a linear regression model that identifies the key drivers of interest rate for 
individual loans. Perform exploratory data analysis of the relationship between the
features and relationship of the features with the response. Select your features and
use `statsmodels` or `sklearn` to build a linear regression model.

You do not have to use all the variables, use good practice to eliminate
variables that are unstable or not contributing to predicting the interest
rate. Focus on building the simplest model that explains interest rate. Justify
the features you have or have not included in your model.

Interested in learning more data science?  One of the fundamental skills you need to start your journey is *programming*.  This class is intended to get you started on a good path towards being a good programmer and a prepared data scientist.

In this one-week course, you’ll learn how to program in Python, we will cover the foundational skills you need to learn to solve Data Science problems in python.

This workshop is for analysts, product managers, statisticians, business managers, and anyone else with little exposure to Python (or programming in general). It is taught by Galvanize's data science instructors and supported by the broader community.

What You’ll Learn / Takeaway:
Whether you’ve programmed in other languages or Python is your first, this class will teach you foundational Python skills. Here’s what you’ll learn:

Environment Setup: Anaconda, Using the Command Line
Fundamentals of Python Programming: Data Structures and Control Flow
Higher Level Programming: Classes and Objects
Useful tools and Libraries: Collections, Itertools, Numpy
Who Should Take this Class?
For those of you interested in learning to program in Python, so you may be better prepared for self-study in data science, this course will help you get up to speed.

Those of you who are interested in gaining the skills required for admittance to the Seattle Data Science Immersive. This course is designed to help you meet that bar.

Course Philosophy:
The Galvanize data science instructors believe that, since code is the major way data scientists develop and communicate thier ideas, data scientists should aspire to be *good* programmers.  This course is designed with this goal in mind.

- We will pay close attention to *clear and clean code* and *good program design* throughout.
- We will write functions and classes to modularize our ideas, and strive to keep our programs self explanatory and readable.
- We will treat *testing* as a *primary and fundametal skill*.  From day one we will write automated tests for our code, and use tests as a primary motivator for code cleanliness and good design.

Prerequisites:
We do not recommend joining the first day of class with *no* exposure to Python, it is important to have at least a small amount of exposure before joining this intense one week class.  We would like you to have some comfort with the following concepts:

- Starting python from a command line.
- Arithmetic in python.
- if statements.
- for loops.

If you have exposure to these concepts in Python or any other language, you have the necessary skills to serve as a foundation for this class.

Setup (please have this in advance): 

• Bring your laptop and power cable.
• Install Anaconda with Python version 2.7 or 3.6 on your machine: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html
• Install a text editor: http://www.atom.io
• If you have trouble with installation, please schedule some time with an instructor to help *before* the first day of class.

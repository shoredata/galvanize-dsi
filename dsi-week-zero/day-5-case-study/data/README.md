### Real Estate Case Study Data ###

The data required for this exercise is too large to store in GitHub. All data required for today's work can be obtained from the [Assessments Data Download](http://info.kingcounty.gov/assessor/DataDownload/default.aspx). Be sure to add these files to `.gitignore` so that you don't accidentally add them to your Git repo.

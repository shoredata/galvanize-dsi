Evaluations and Checks for Understanding
---
Besides Assessments that will happen every couple weeks (see below), the curriculum is built around practical exercises that will let you check your understanding, track your progress and mastery of the material so that you can focus on the skills you need to improve.

These exercises are:

* Mini-quizzes (most mornings)
* Individual sprints (individual.md)
* Pair sprints (pair.md)

Course Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------  
### Attendance

Please email your lead instructor in advance if you will be missing any day of class.  The material is dense and builds on itself quickly, so please try to make it to every day of class.  

- Once a student has received two unexcused absences the student will receive a warning from the Registrar and be placed on probation.
- After a student has received three unexcused absences the student is subject to automatic administrative dismissal at the discretion of the instructor.

### Assessments
Data Science Immersive students will have regular weekly written assessments to check for understanding on the material and skills covered that week.  Those students who have received less than cumulative average of 30% score on assessments will be placed on academic probation and required to show improvement before the following written assessment. Assessment-1 is a diagnostic test on day 1, and will not count towards the average.  The Final assessment is weighed 40% and will count significantly towards the final score.  

Assessment-2:  15%, Assessment-3:  15%, Assessment-4:  15%, Assessment-5:  15%, Final Assessment:  40%

Students who are underperforming will be informed of their progress by an instructor and indicated in the official student files.  If a student on probation continues to perform below this minimum level after the next written assessment could be administratively withdrawn from the program.  

Each question in an assessment follows the below **grading scheme**:

* Grade out of 3 points:
    - 0 points: No response, or basically no idea
    - 1 point: Some idea, but doesn't totally get it
    - 2 points: On track, but has a bug or small misunderstanding
    - 3 points: Great!

For example, consider the following question:

You fit a linear regression to predict SAT score with many predictors, one of which is whether or not the student was homeschooled. `Beta_homeschool = -40`.How do you interpret the coefficient?

A correct (3/3) answer would be, "Holding all else constant, homeschooled students scored 40 points less on the SAT than non-homeschooled students."

Answers that omit "holding all else constant" or "than non-homeschooled students" would be scored 2/3.

A one-point answer might be something like, "Homeschooled students scored less on the SAT."


### Career Services Participation
Galvanize Immersive Courses focus on acquiring technical competencies, building an employment portfolio, and preparing to succeed in interviews for roles relevant to the course content. In order to complete a Galvanize Immersive program, a student must participate in the Career Services Program:
* deliver a capstone project approved by Lead Instructor.  
  * Repository requirements must follow every section of Code Cleanup and README requirements as outlined in [designing_your_repo](https://github.com/gschool/dsi-project-proposals/blob/master/designing_your_repo.md).  
  * Plagiarism is an automatic failure.  Work which is not the studentâ€™s must be cited correctly.
* complete an approved resume
* complete approved online profile(s) assigned by Career Services Team
* complete a mock recruiter phone screen with Career Services Team and technical interview with a designated Instructor.
